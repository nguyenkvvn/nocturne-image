Welcome to Nocturne!

If you are trying to set up Nocturne, please refer to
the GitHub: https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-image

If you are experienced and you want to change something, you may
remount the rootfs as read-write with: mount -o remount,rw /

You can use the wingman utility to adjust device stuff, such
as A/B data and more. https://github.com/usenocturne/wingman
