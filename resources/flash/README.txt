# Nocturne Installer

Disclaimer: Bricking the Car Thing is nearly impossible, but the risk is always there when flashing custom partition tables.

Use https://github.com/JoeyEamigh/flashthing to flash the zip to your Car Thing: 
flashthing-cli /path/to/nocturne_installer.zip

---

To Uninstall:
flashthing-cli --unbrick

Then, use a tool of your choice (Terbium or FlashThing recommended) to flash stock or a different firmware.
