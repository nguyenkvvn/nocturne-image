# Nocturne Installer

Disclaimer: Bricking the Car Thing is nearly impossible, but the risk is always there when flashing custom partition tables.

Use "sudo ./flash.sh" (Linux/macOS) or double click flash.bat (Windows) to flash Nocturne to your Car Thing.

---

To Uninstall:
Use a tool of your choice to flash stock or a different firmware.
If it's failing, use:
Windows: .\flashthing-cli.exe --unbrick
Linux/macOS: sudo ./flashthing-cli --unbrick
